The custom-made location widget is an appropriate addition to the planner app as it enhances the functionality and usability of the app. With the location widget, users can associate specific locations with their reminders or tasks, providing context and enabling better organization. It allows users to either manually enter a location or fetch their current location, providing flexibility and convenience.

To use the location widget, users can simply input the desired location in the input field. They can also click the "Get Current Location" button to automatically fetch their current location using the Geolocation API. The widget then displays the fetched location name, providing users with a more descriptive and meaningful representation of their current whereabouts.

This feature proves beneficial in various scenarios, such as setting reminders for specific places, planning events at specific venues, or organizing tasks based on different locations. By incorporating the location widget into the planner app, users can effectively manage their tasks and reminders in a location-centric manner, improving productivity and organization.
